HtmlAnalyzer4DotNet
===================

An experimental project to find out what can be achieved when combining NSoup and ExCss libraries.

The tool can fetch HTML documents from the URLs you specify and provide you with a couple of
different categories of information about the HTML document.

Currently the following information categories are supported:
* Document title
* List of meta tags
* List of anchor tags
* List of CSS clases
* List of CSS rules
* List of images (the ability to fetch and view images is available)
* HTML raw view
